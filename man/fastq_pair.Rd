\description{
Rewrite paired end fastq files to make sure that all reads have a mate and to
separate out singletons.

Usually when you get paired end read files you have two files with a /1
sequence in one and a /2 sequence in the other (or a /f and /r or just two
reads with the same ID). However, often when working with files from a third
party source (e.g. the SRA) there are different numbers of reads in each file
(because some reads fail QC). Spades, bowtie2 and other tools break because
they demand paired end files have the same number of reads.
