Thank you for your valuable feedback. We would like to clarify the following points in response to your comments:

1. References in the DESCRIPTION file: We would like to explain that our package
   provides a convenient interface to call the `system2` function for running
   command line tools. We do not directly rely on external methods or algorithms
   that would require formal referencing. Therefore, we believe there is no need
   to add additional references to the DESCRIPTION file. 

2. Authors@R field and copyright: In accordance with your suggestion, we have
   reviewed the Authors@R field in the DESCRIPTION file. The cph (copyright
   holder) field has been removed, as we follow the copyright and licensing
   information outlined in the LICENSE file, which provides the necessary
   details and correct information about copyright holders. We have ensured that
   the roles of authors and contributors are accurately represented in the
   DESCRIPTION file as per CRAN guidelines.
