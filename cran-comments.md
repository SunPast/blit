Thank you for your valuable feedback. Following your suggestions, I have thoroughly reviewed all the code included from external sources. In response, I have added a LICENSE.note file to describe the overall license of the package and the specific licenses for each individual component. Accordingly, the Authors@R field has been updated to reflect the LICENSE information.
